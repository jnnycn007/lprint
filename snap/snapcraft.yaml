summary: A Label Printer Application
description: |
   LPrint implements printing for a variety of common label and receipt printers
   connected via network or USB.  Features include:

   - A single executable handles spooling, status, and server functionality.
   - Multiple printer support.
   - Each printer implements an IPP Everywhereâ„¢ print service and is compatible
     with the driverless printing support in iOS, macOS, and Linux clients.
   - Each printer can support options such as label modes, tear-off offsets,
     media tracking, media top offset, print darkness, resolution, roll
     selection, and speed.
   - Each printer can print "raw", Apple/PWG Raster, and/or PNG files.

   For more information, see the file "DOCUMENTATION.md", the man pages in the
   "man" directory, and/or the LPrint project page at
   "https://www.msweet.org/lprint".
